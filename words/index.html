        <h2> There is no self, there is just awareness </h2>
        <h3 class="width"> You have to be aware of your evolution and the fact that it’s happening. Otherwise you won't be able to shed perspectives you have on yourself that are hindering positive growth. 
We are evolving. Evolution is inevitable. </h3>
<h2> God gives us suffering but He also gives us relief </h2>

<p class="phone"> A girl picks up the phone. 

The boy has work to do and loves the girl. 
He begs the girl to request it of him. 
He knows he has to work. 
He wants to want to work. 
The girl has power that she holds 
within herself. 
The boy knows she has her power. 
He wants the girl. 

Please. He says. 

The girl, giggling hysterically
gets out-

“If you don’t work-“  

She is grinning. 
She is most amused by the power. 
She looks at him and knows she could muster up more of it. 
She loves the boy. The boy is hers. 

She regains composure, breathes in with control, and says 

“Or I am no longer interested” 
-finally releasing from of her mouth.

Their eyes smirk. 

Then he smiles and says his goodbyes.

<h3> When you manifest, you create the kind of person who walks into an opportunity. 

Your success comes in your own way.  </h3>

<p class="reasons"> Me: "Nothing can be known and there are especially no reasons"

<br> My date: "Wait that makes sense" </p>

<p class="time"> It’s a strange feeling<br>
Remembering the first moments of a particular time in your life<br>
One you wish you could revisit.<br>
It feels like another lifetime when it all began.<br>
So long ago it makes you want to hurl from the velocity in which your brain travels there and back<br>

You had an infinite amount of those moments while you lived them<br>
Even though you stayed present in each one, they still came to an end.<br>
If you remember a moment vivid enough you almost time travel.<br>
Back to your favorite place, coffee shop, country store<br>
It feels like the moment is still happening. <br>
And somewhere in your mind it is. <br>
Each moment is eternal. <br>

You’re in a different part of life now<br>
You’ve moved on<br>
If you imagine getting the chance to relive one perfect day<br>
You feel a tightening<br>
Like the awareness of your present self getting squeezed into a previous version<br>
You’ve evolved and the experience could never repeat itself<br>

Your eyes have been opened<br>
Somedays you wish you could squeeze them shut<br>
Turn around, run back, and stay in the warmth of familiarity<br>

Instead you remain in the present moment<br>
Ignoring the icky feeling of time passed too quickly <br>
and the disconnect you feel between the acceptance of an End and the endless time you felt was yours.  <br>

Each moment turned you into the person you are now<br>
They’ll keep coming and you should live them while they’re happening<br>
You have so many more to go<br>

You had a little infinity<br>
You say it’ll never really be over because it feels right <br>
You wonder if you should trust that feeling of safety<br>
Forever won’t go by without seeing you again <br>

I’ll meet you in our memories
</p>
<h3> "I prefer bitter cold to anything else." 
Turns around. No response. 
My wits are wasted here.  </h3>

<p> I am very present in this class right now<br>
I am very aware of my professors humanity<br>

“If you miss the question on the global care chain, I’ll be so pissed” <br>
*Exasperated, smile, joking, release of tension*<br>

I am so excited to get out of this class <br>
I have 10 minutes left<br>

I am smiling under my mask in anticipation<br>

My nickel blue board, the refreshing warm air, the smell of leaves<br>

My groovy pants <br>

My lovely mood
